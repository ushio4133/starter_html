        <p>Macaroni and cheese, commonly known as mac & cheese, is a comfort food staple that has captured the hearts of people all over the world. Originating from Europe and popularized in the United States, this dish consists of elbow macaroni pasta smothered in a creamy cheese sauce. The simplicity of its ingredients—pasta, cheese, and often a touch of butter or milk—belies a rich, complex flavor that has made it a favorite for both quick weeknight dinners and festive holiday gatherings.</p>
